## ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing Cloud-Free Images

No cloud-free Sentinel-2 images were found for the following year-month combinations:

```
2016-05
2016-07
2016-09
2017-06
2017-07
2017-08
2020-07
2021-08
2024-06
2024-07
2024-08
```

These gaps are due to persistent cloud cover during those periods, which made it impossible to generate clean NDVI composites.
